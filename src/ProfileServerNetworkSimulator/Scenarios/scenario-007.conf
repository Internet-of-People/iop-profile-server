# In this scenario, we create two servers and then we create 100 identities on the first server.
# We wait a while and then we stop the second server and we create another 100 identities on 
# the first server in several batches. The second server is started then and we check whether 
# the 100 new identities were correctly shared with the second server.

# Create two profile servers A001 and A002 within 50 km radius of GPS location [10.0, 20.0].
