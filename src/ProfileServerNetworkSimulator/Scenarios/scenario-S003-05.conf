# In this scenario, we load snapshot S003, in which we have
# server neighborhoods A001-A005 and B001-B003, each server hosting 
# some identities. We create some new neighbor relations, cancel 
# some existing relations, create some new identities, and cancel 
# some existing identities. Then we perform some search queries.
