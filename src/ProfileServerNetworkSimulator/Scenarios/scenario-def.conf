# COMMANDS:
#
# ProfileServer
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Creates one or more profile servers with associated LBN server. The servers are not started until 
# StartServer is called. This allows creating the neighborhoods before the servers start, which better 
# mimic the real life scenarios. 
#
# Usage: ProfileServer <GroupName> <Count> <BasePort> <Latitude> <Longitude> <Radius>
#  * GroupName - Name of the group of profile servers. Each profile server will be created with its own 
#                name, which constists of the GroupName as a prefix and a 3 digit suffix, which is the index 
#                of the instance in the group. 'Count' instances are going to be created with first instance 
#                named GroupName + "001", second instance named GroupName + "002" etc.
#  * Count - Number of instances to create. An integer between 1 and 999.
#  * BasePort - TCP port number from which TCP ports of each profile server and associated LBN servers 
#               are to be calculated. For each server instance in the group, there are 20 ports allocated.
#               This means that instance number 001 is going to use ports between BasePort and BasePort + 19,
#               instance number 002 is going to use ports between BasePort + 20 and BasePort + 39, etc.
#  * Latitude - GPS latitude in the decimal form of the target area centre. 
#  * Longitude - GPS longitude in the decimal form of the target area centre.
#  * Radius - Radius in metres that together with Latitude and Longitude specify the target area, in which 
#             a random location will be selected for each instance as its location. Value of 0 means that 
#             all servers will be created in the exact location given by Latitude and Longitude. Maximal 
#             Radius is 20,000,000.
